              <p>
			According to the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> recommendation, 
			"<i>Open Science is the movement to make scientific research and data accessible to all. 
			It includes practices such as publishing open scientific research, campaigning for open access and 
			generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific knowledge. 
			Additionally, it includes other ways to make science more transparent and accessible during the research process. 
			This includes open notebook science, citizen science, and aspects of open source software and crowdfunded research projects</i>".
