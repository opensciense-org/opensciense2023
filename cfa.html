                            OpenScienSE 2023 introduces an Artifact Track and artifact badging in the context of CBSoft! International conferences already have artifact evaluation tracks and artifact badging. This movement inspired OpenScienSE to bring this tendency to CBSoft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to <a title="the ESEC/FSE 2023 webpage" href="https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-artifacts" target="_blank">the ESEC/FSE 2023 webpage</a>, papers associated with badges contain reusable products that other researchers
                            can use to bootstrap their own research, and experience shows that such papers earn increased citations and greater prestige in the research community.
                        </p>
                        </br>

                            Authors of <strong>papers accepted to the SBES 2023 Research Track</strong> are invited to submit artifacts associated with those papers to the OpenScienSE 2023 Artifact Track for evaluation. The artifacts might be considered
                            <strong>Available</strong> or <strong>Functional</strong>, which would result in earning the respective artifact badges (see below). These badges are considered independent and both can be applied to any given paper.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                <li>The paper will be marked with the badge(s) in the list of accepted papers on the webpage of the SBES 2023 Research Track;</li>
                                <li>The artifact will compete for a Best Artifact Award, which will be given by OpenScienSE to recognize the effort of authors in creating and sharing outstanding research artifacts.</li>

                            "Artifact" is an umbrella term for several kinds of materials and products. It includes simpler materials such as interview questionnaires applied in surveys and more complex products such as fully-automated tools. All artifacts that might be useful for
                            future research projects are welcome!

                        <p>
                            Artifacts of interest include, but are not limited to:

                            The research artifacts themselves (i.e., the content of repositories) should be self-contained. This means that all instructions about the artifacts (how they are organized, how they can be used, etc.) should be in the repositories. This is because people
                            other than the OpenScienSE committee must be able to access and use the artifacts. That is the whole reason for sharing artifacts, after all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Authors must perform the following steps to prepare an artifact to be submitted.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Preparing and Documenting the Artifact</h4>
                        <p>
                            A submitted repository’s artifact must contain the artifact files themselves and documentation about them. Below, authors can see the expected repository’s structure:
                            <pre style="text-align: left; white-space: pre-line;">
                                ├── &lt;artifact folder and files>
                                ├── README
                                ├── LICENSE
                                ├── REQUIREMENTS (for source-code-related artifacts)
                                └── INSTALL (for source-code-related artifacts)
                            </pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A <strong>README</strong> file is the document that any person will want to read when accessing the artifacts’ repositories. It should describe what the artifact is, cite the paper associated with the artifact, and explain
                            how the repository is organized. This is the very minimum for other people to get interested in using the artifact. Artifacts that focus on data should, in principle, cover aspects relevant to understanding the context, data
                            provenance, ethical and legal statements (as long as relevant), and storage requirements. Artifacts that focus on software should, in principle, cover aspects relevant to how to install and use it (and be accompanied by a small
                            example). For the latter, the README file should link the REQUIREMENTS and INSTALL files (see below).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A <strong>LICENSE</strong> file describing the distribution rights. The license needs to be some form of open-source license.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A <strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong> file for artifacts that focus on software. This file must describe the requirements for executing the software system. Basic requirements, e.g., Java version, should be described. If relevant,
                            a requirements.txt with explicit versioning information (e.g., for Python-only environments) should be provided. For completeness and fully-functional software systems, this file should cover aspects of hardware environment
                            requirements (e.g., performance, storage, or non-commodity peripherals) and software environments (e.g., Docker, VM, and operating system).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An <strong>INSTALL</strong> file with installation instructions. These instructions should include notes illustrating a very basic usage example or a method to test the installation. This could be, for instance, on what output
                            to expect that confirms that the code is installed and working.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an overall rule, the authors should provide enough associated instruction, code, and data such that some CS person with a reasonable knowledge of scripting, build tools, etc., could install, build, and run the code.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Making the Artifact Available</h4>
                        <p>
                            The authors must make the artifact publicly available so that the Evaluation Committee (and potential users of the artifact) can access it. We suggest a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub) or to a single archive file in a widely available archive
                            format. We encourage authors to use permanent repositories dedicated to data sharing where no registration is necessary for those accessing the artifacts (e.g., please avoid using services such as GoogleDrive).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that the JEMS submission should include the research abstract only providing links to the repositories where the artifact is permanently stored and available. Submitting artifacts themselves through JEMS without making them publicly accessible
                            (through a repository or an archival service) will not be sufficient for any further badge.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Submitting the Artifact</h4>
                        <p>
                            Artifacts must be submitted electronically through <a href="https://jems.sbc.org.br/home.cgi?c=4415" target="_blank">the JEMS system</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Review Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            The OpenScienSE Evaluation Committee may contact the authors within the reviewing period to request clarifications on the basic installation and start-up procedures or to resolve simple installation problems. Instructions will further be sent to the authors
                            (and reviewers) along the reviewing process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the short review time available, the authors are expected to respond within a 48-hour period. Authors may update their research artifacts during the reviewing period only for changes requested by reviewers in the reviewing period.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In case of questions, please do not hesitate to contact the chairs.
                        </p>
